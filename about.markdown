A project for digitizing the entire Hendricks family recipe collection for posterity!

Website is created and maintained by Liam, but recipe content curated and added by many family members. If you have questions or feature requests for the website, ask Liam and I'm sure he can figure something out.

Special thanks to all the great Hendricks and Eliason chefs out there for your culinary contributions.
