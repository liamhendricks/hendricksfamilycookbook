Recipe from Grandma Eliason. A Deer Valley treat. 

## Ingredients
* 1 egg
* 1/2 cup shortening
* 1/2 cup butter, softened
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 1 package Devil's Food cake mix
* 1/2 gallon brick ice cream (vanilla or any flavor)

### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
2. Beat egg, shortening, butter, vanilla and half of the dry cake mix until smooth. Then stir in remaining cake mix. 
3. Divide dough into 4 equal parts. Roll each part into a 10" x 6" rectangle. (Mark out the rectangle measurements with a pencil on pastry cloth, and use a piece of wax paper on top of the dough. It will roll out easily.)
4. Cut into rectangles, 3" x 2 1/2" each (Each of the 4 equal parts makes 8 cookie sections.)
5. Place rectangles on ungreased baking sheet. Bake 6 minutes. Prick surfaces of cookies lightly with a fork. Cool. 
6. Cut ice cream brick into 16 pieces. 
7. Place each ice cream rectangle between 2 cooled cookies; gently press together to spread ice cream to edges of cookies. 
8. Wrap in aluminum foil. Freeze at least 24 hours. Makes 16 sandwiches.
