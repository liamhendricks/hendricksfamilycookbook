Probably not the healthiest soup, but over the years I substituted real shredded cheese for the previous Velveeta Cheese. This soup is great in bread bowls. When you kids were young, this was a meal you all ate! 

## Ingredients
* 3 cups chicken broth
* 1 cup finely chopped celery
* 1/2 cup finely chopped onion
* 4 cups potatoes, diced small
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 3/4 cup butter
* 3/4 cup flour
* 1 quart half and half
* 4 cups cheddar cheese, shredded

### Directions
1. Chop vegetables and cook gently in chicken broth for about 10 minutes. Remove from heat.
2. Melt butter in a small pan and add flour. Stir into cooked veggies.
3. Add half and half (or milk) to mixture, stirring well. 
4. Add cheddar cheese, stir well. 
5. Cook over low heat or simmer until thickened.
