Liam's favorite cookie! They are simple, only take a few ingredients, and are quick to bake in the oven. 

## Ingredients

* 1 cup unsalted butter (softened)
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 1/2 cup powdered sugar (plus more for garnish)
* 2 1/4 cups flour
* 1/4 tsp salt
* (optional) 3/4 cup crushed walnuts, pecans or pistachios

## Directions

1. Cream together butter, vanilla and powdered sugar in a stand mixer.
2. Slowly mix in the flour and salt until combined.
3. If you are using nuts, stir them in now.
4. Use a cookie scoop to make 1 inch balls, and place them on a parchment lined baking sheet.
5. Bake at 350 degrees for 12-13 minutes.
6. While still warm, roll in more powdered sugar.
