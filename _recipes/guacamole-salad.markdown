A favorite salad of mine from a neighborhood friend, Heidi Richards.

* Head of lettuce
* 2 tomatoes, wedged
* 1/2 cup green onions
* 1 cup corn chips
* 1/2 cup cheddar cheese, grated

### Dressing Ingredients
* 1/2 cup mashed avocado
* 1 TB lemon juice
* 1/2 cup sour cream
* 1/3 cup oil
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 1/2 tsp sugar
* 1/2 tsp chili powder
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 2 drops Tabasco sauce

### Directions
1. Combine all salad ingredients, except corn chips. 
2. Mix dressing ingredients and pour over salad and mix very thoroughly so dressing is completely through all salad ingredients. 
3. Add corn chips and lightly mix them into salad.
