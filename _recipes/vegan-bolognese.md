My plant-based version of a classic, hearty tomato sauce. Instead of the traditional ground beef or pork, we will use lentils and walnuts as a replacement. I personally think it's one of the few vegan "meat" dishes that tastes better without the meat. Carly and I eat it all the time.

This recipe makes enough to feed 4 adults easily. Serve it with your choice of noodles - I think it goes well with spaghetti or linguini noodles, myself. Sprinkle some parmesan on top if you eat dairy.

## Ingredients

* 1 yellow onion or shallot, diced
* 2 carrots, diced
* 2 to 3 stalks celery, diced
* 2 to 3 cloves garlic, diced
* olive oil
* 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
* 1 can of diced tomatoes
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 2 cups tomato sauce
* 1/2 cup walnuts, crushed
* 1 cup lentils, cooked
* dried oregano
* salt
* pepper
* (optional) red pepper flakes
* (optional) dried or fresh basil

## Directions

1. Cook your lentils according to the packaging, and set them aside.
2. In a skillet over medium heat, cook onions, carrots and celery in some olive oil. Add a pinch of salt, the dried oregano and red pepper flakes. Once the vegetables are soft add the garlic and cook for a few more minutes. Add the tomato paste and stir it around so it coats everything. Once the paste starts to stick to the pan a bit, deglaze with the red wine vinegar. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the pan clean. Add the diced tomatoes and tomato sauce, stir everything together. Add the lentils and walnuts.
3. Simmer for at least 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4. Serve over the noodles of your choice.
