From one of my Bunco friends, Kim Butler. 

## Ingredients
* 1/2 cup canola oil
* 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1/2 tsp worcestshire sauce
* 1/2 tsp garlic salt
* 1/2 tsp salt

### Directions
Mix all ingredients in a blender until it emulsifies. If you want it a little thinner, add a 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup of water.
