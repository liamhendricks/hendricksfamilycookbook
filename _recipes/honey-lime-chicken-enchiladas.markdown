Pinterest recipe - Honey Lime Chicken Enchiladas are loaded with juicy marinated chicken, smothered in creamy enchilada sauce and topped with melted cheese. 

## Ingredients
* 1 small onion, diced
* 3 chicken breast halves
* 1/2 cup chicken broth
* 1 TB chili powder
* 1 tsp garlic, minced (2-3 cloves)
* 10 corn or flour tortillas
* 1 pound Monterey Jack Cheese, shredded
* 16 oz. green enchilada sauce (Las Palmas branc)
* 1/2 cup heavy cream

### Directions
1. Sauté onion in a little butter until it becomes transparent and soft. 
2. In a crock pot add chicken, chicken broth, sautéed onion, chili powder, garlic, and salt and pepper. Cook on low for about 8 hours or on high for 3-4 hours adding more broth if needed. (you don't want it to cook out completely.)
3. Drain out some of the juices (keeping 1/4 cup) and add honey and lime. Place seasoned, shredded chicken in a Ziploc bag and seal tightly, pressing out as much air as you can. 
4. Marinate at least 30-40 minutes or up to an hour. 
5. While chicken is marinating spray a 9 x 13 pan with cooking spray, then pour about 1/2 cup of enchilada sauce over the bottom. Fill tortillas with chicken mixture and shredded cheese, saving about 1 cup of cheese to sprinkle on top of enchiladas.
6. Mix the remaining enchilada sauce with heavy cream. Pour sauce on top of the enchiladas and sprinkle with cheese.
7. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes until brown and crispy on top. Serve hot and top with your favorite enchilada toppings.
