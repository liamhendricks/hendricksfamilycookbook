We make this every year after the tomato harvest. 

## Ingredients
* 6 lbs. Roma tomatoes (plum or Roma)
* 1/2 cup chopped onion
* 1/2 cup chopped celery
* 3 large cloves garlic, minced
* 2 TB olive oil or cooking oil
* 2 tsp sugar
1-2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1/8 tsp ground red cayenne pepper (optional)

### Directions
1. In a large kettle, bring 4 inches of water to boiling. Immerse tomatoes in boiling water for a few minutes. Drain in Colander; peel, seed, and chop tomatoes (about 10 cups). 
2. In the same kettle cook onion, celery, and garlic in hot oil about 5 minutes or until tender. Add tomatoes, sugar, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper, if desired. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Simmer, uncovered, for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add oregano and thyme; simmer uncovered for 15 minutes more. Cool slightly. 
3. In a food processor, process sauce one fourth at a time to desired texture. Place sauce in a bowl set in ice water to cool quickly. 
4. Fill freezer containers and seal tightly. Label and freeze. 
5. Serve hot over pasta. Makes 3-4 pints.
